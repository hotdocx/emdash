# TASK_SCRATCHPAD_002_Fix_Proof_Mode_Test.md

## What has already been implemented:
- **Verified Linter Fix:** Confirmed that the user's manual fix for the TypeScript linter error in `src/proof.ts` was correct and preserved the intended semantics.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigated the failing test `"should correctly manage a simple proof with intro and exact"`. The error `Assertion Failed: Expected zero holes after exact. Found 1` was caused by the `intro` tactic creating a `Lam` with a body function `(_ => Hole(...))` that generated a new, unsolved hole instance on every evaluation.
- **Fix Implemented:** Modified the `intro` function in `src/proof.ts`. The hole for the lambda body is now created once, outside the body function's scope, and the function simply returns this single instance. This ensures that when the hole is solved, all subsequent checks see the solved reference.
- **Test Verification:** Ran the test suite `tests/proof_mode_tests.ts` and confirmed that all tests now pass, including the previously failing one.
