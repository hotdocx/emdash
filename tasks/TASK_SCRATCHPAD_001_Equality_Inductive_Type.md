# TASK: Implement tests for the `Eq` inductive type family

## Status: DONE

## Implemented

A new test suite was added in `tests/equality_inductive_type_family.ts` to cover the behavior of the indexed inductive type for equality, `Eq`.

The following has been implemented and tested:

1.  **Global Declarations**:
    *   `Eq`: The type family `Π {A:Type}. A -> A -> Type`.
    *   `refl`: The constructor `Π {A:Type} {x:A}. Eq {A} x x`.
    *   `Eq_elim`: The eliminator `J`, which allows for induction over proofs of equality.

2.  **Induction via Eliminator**:
    *   A rewrite rule `Eq_elim_refl` was added to define the computational behavior of the eliminator.
    *   **Symmetry (`symm_elim`)**: A proof of `Π {A} {x y} (p: Eq x y) -> Eq y x` was defined using `Eq_elim` and tested.
    *   **Transitivity (`trans_elim`)**: A proof of `Π {A} {x y z} (p: Eq x y) (q: Eq y z) -> Eq x z` was defined using `Eq_elim` and tested.

3.  **Induction via Rewrite Rules**:
    *   As an alternative to using the full eliminator, key properties were also defined directly using pattern-matching rewrite rules.
    *   **Symmetry (`symm_rw`)**: Defined with a rule `symm (refl x) = refl x`.
    *   **Transitivity (`trans_rw`)**: Defined with a rule `trans (refl x) q = q`.
    *   **Congruence (`cong_rw`)**: The property `cong f (refl x) = refl (f x)` for a function `f` was defined and tested.

All tests are passing, demonstrating that the core system correctly handles dependent pattern matching and rewriting for indexed inductive types.

## Next Steps

This task is now complete. We can archive this scratchpad and proceed with the next development phase.

**Suggested next prompt:** `The tests for the equality type look good. Now, let's move on to the next task.`
