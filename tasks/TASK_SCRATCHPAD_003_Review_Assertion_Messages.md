# TASK_SCRATCHPAD_003_Review_Assertion_Messages.md

## What has already been implemented:
- **Review of Assertion Messages:** Conducted a thorough review of all `assert` function messages in `tests/proof_mode_tests.ts`.
- **Analysis of Phrasing:** Analyzed whether the messages accurately reflect the success condition of each assertion.
- **Conclusion:** Determined that the assertion messages are correctly phrased to describe the *expected outcome* for a passing test. They clearly state what should be true for the test to succeed, and if the condition is not met, they provide informative feedback about the discrepancy (e.g., `Expected zero holes... Found X`). This is standard and effective practice for unit test assertions.

## What remains to be implemented:
- No changes are required for this task. The assertion messages are correct as they are.
