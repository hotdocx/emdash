# Task: Implement New Parser and Syntax

- **Status**: Completed
- **Files**: `src/parser2.ts`, `tests/parser_tests2.ts`

## Summary

This task involved the creation of a new parser for the language, featuring a more conventional, ASCII-based syntax. The goal was to move away from Unicode characters (like `λ` and `Π`) and introduce more flexible syntax for binders, such as grouped binders `(x y : A)` and untyped binders `\ x . ...`.

## Implemented Features

1.  **New Parser File (`src/parser2.ts`)**: A new parser was built from scratch using `parsimmon`. It is completely independent of the old parser (`src/parser.ts`).
2.  **ASCII-based Syntax**:
    *   Lambdas are denoted by `\` or `lambda`.
    *   Pi types are denoted by `->` for both dependent and non-dependent functions. The parser correctly distinguishes them based on whether the left-hand side is a binder group like `(x : A)` or a simple type `A`.
3.  **Advanced Binder Support**:
    *   **Grouped Binders**: Supports `(x y z : Type)` in both lambdas and Pi types.
    *   **Implicit Binders**: Supports `{x : Type}`, `{x y : Type}`, and untyped `{x y}`.
    *   **Mixed Binders**: Correctly parses sequences of different binder types, e.g., `\ {A : Type} (x : A) . x`.
4.  **Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/parser_tests2.ts`)**: A new test file was created with a wide range of test cases covering all aspects of the new syntax, including primitives, lambdas, Pi types, application precedence, let-expressions, and complex nested terms.
5.  **Iterative Debugging**: The parser was developed iteratively. Initial versions had significant issues with ambiguity and precedence, which were systematically resolved by refactoring the parser grammar to be more robust and less ambiguous. All tests in `tests/parser_tests2.ts` are now passing.

## Remaining Tasks

The new parser is complete and appears to be working correctly according to the tests. The next logical step would be to integrate it into the main application, potentially replacing the old parser. This would involve:

*   Updating any code that currently calls `parseToSyntaxTree` to use `parseToSyntaxTree2` instead.
*   Deciding whether to deprecate and remove the old `src/parser.ts` and `tests/parser_tests.ts` files.

For now, this task can be considered finished and the scratchpad archived.

**Next suggested prompt**: "Now that the new parser is complete and tested, please replace the old parser with the new one throughout the codebase. Remove the old files `src/parser.ts` and `tests/parser_tests.ts`."
