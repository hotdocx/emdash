# TASK_SCRATCHPAD_001_Analyze_Codebase.md

## Task Overview
The main task is to review and analyze the codebase to:
1. Update the existing `README.md` file (which may be outdated, incorrect, or incomplete).
2. Create a new `README2.md` file with a detailed summary of the codebase.

## Progress - Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

### What has been implemented:
- **Listed Directory Contents**: I have successfully listed the contents of both `src/` and `tests/` directories to get an overview of the file structure.
  - `src/` contents:
    - `constants.ts`
    - `elaboration.ts`
    - `equality.ts`
    - `globals.ts`
    - `parser.ts`
    - `pattern.ts`
    - `proof.ts`
    - `reduction.ts`
    - `state.ts`
    - `stdlib.ts`
    - `structural.ts`
    - `types.ts`
    - `unification.ts`
    - `util.ts` (This file was originally in the list but was not found during reading, confirmed by `list_dir`).
  - `tests/` contents:
    - `parser_tests.ts`
    - `main_tests.ts`
    - `rewrite_rules_tests2.ts`
    - `let_binding_tests.ts`
    - `church_encoding_tests.ts`
    - `church_encoding_implicit_tests.ts`
    - `equality_inductive_type_family.ts`
    - `dependent_types_tests.ts`
    - `elaboration_options_tests.ts`
    - `equality_tests.ts`
    - `error_reporting_tests.ts`
    - `functorial_elaboration.ts`
    - `higher_order_pattern_matching_tests.ts`
    - `higher_order_unification_tests.ts`
    - `implicit_args_tests.ts`
    - `inductive_types.ts`
    - `kernel_implicits_tests.ts`
    - `phase1_tests.ts`
    - `proof_mode_tests.ts`
    - `rewrite_rules_tests.ts`
    - `utils.ts`

- **Read Entire Files**: I have successfully read the *entire* content of all files found in both `src/` and `tests/` directories. This ensures a complete understanding of the codebase for generating the `README2.md`.

### What remains to be implemented:
- **Generate `README2.md`**: Create a new file `README2.md` containing a detailed summary of the codebase, based on the analysis of all read files.
- **Update `README.md`**: Review and update the existing `README.md` to ensure it is accurate and complete, possibly by referencing or incorporating parts of `README2.md`.
- **Review and Archive**: After the above steps, this task scratchpad can be archived.

### Next User Prompt:
The next step is to generate the content for `README2.md`. I will analyze the gathered information and propose the content for `README2.md`.
