# Task: Remove `isSubElaboration` Feature

**Date:** 2024-07-28
**Project Phase:** Refactoring / Code Cleanup

## 1. Task Description

The `isSubElaboration` parameter in `src/elaboration.ts` (`infer` and `check` functions) was identified as potentially obsolete. The original purpose was likely related to managing elaboration depth or constraint solving for sub-expressions, but subsequent changes (e.g., calling `solveConstraints` more frequently after `addConstraint`) seemed to have made it redundant.

The goal was to:
1.  Carefully review the usage of `isSubElaboration`.
2.  If confirmed to be unnecessary, remove it from function signatures (`infer`, `check`).
3.  Update all call sites within the codebase to reflect this change.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. Analysis of `isSubElaboration`

-   The parameter was present in `infer(ctx: Context, term: Term, stackDepth: number = 0, isSubElaboration: boolean = false): InferResult` and `check(ctx: Context, term: Term, expectedType: Term, stackDepth: number = 0, isSubElaboration: boolean = false): Term`.
-   Within `src/elaboration.ts`, all recursive calls to `infer` and `check` passed `isSubElaboration: true`.
-   Calls from external files (e.g., `src/globals.ts`) omitted the parameter, relying on its default `false` value.
-   The parameter did not appear to control any distinct logic paths other than being passed down in recursive calls.
-   The JSDoc comments indicated its purpose was to flag recursive calls.

Conclusion: The parameter was indeed redundant due to other improvements in the constraint solving strategy.

### 2.2. Code Modifications

-   **File:** `src/elaboration.ts`
    -   **`infer` function:**
        -   Removed `isSubElaboration: boolean = false` from the signature.
        -   Removed the corresponding JSDoc line.
        -   Removed the last boolean argument (which was `true`) from all internal calls to `infer(...)` and `check(...)`.
    -   **`check` function:**
        -   Removed `isSubElaboration: boolean = false` from the signature.
        -   Removed the corresponding JSDoc line.
        -   Removed the last boolean argument (which was `true`) from all internal calls to `infer(...)` and `check(...)`.
    -   **`elaborate` function:**
        -   Calls to `check(...)` within `elaborate` that previously passed `true` for `isSubElaboration` were updated to remove this argument.

### 2.3. Verification

-   A `grep` search for "isSubElaboration" in `*.ts` files was performed, yielding no results. This confirmed its complete removal from code and comments.
-   The automated diff from the `edit_file` tool showed comprehensive changes across `src/elaboration.ts`, covering signatures and numerous call sites as intended.

## 3. What has been implemented

-   The `isSubElaboration` parameter has been completely removed from the `infer` and `check` functions in `src/elaboration.ts`.
-   All call sites for these functions within `src/elaboration.ts` have been updated.
-   JSDoc comments for these functions have been updated.

## 4. What remains to be implemented

-   No further implementation steps are identified for *this specific task*.
-   The codebase should be tested to ensure no regressions were introduced, although the change is expected to be safe given the analysis.

## 5. Next Steps & Conclusion

-   **Ready to archive this task file:** Yes.
-   **Next suggested user prompt:** "Let's run the test suite to ensure the recent refactoring in `src/elaboration.ts` (removal of `isSubElaboration`) didn't introduce any regressions."
