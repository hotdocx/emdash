# TASK_SCRATCHPAD_004_Rephrase_Assertion_Messages.md

## What has already been implemented:
- **Rephrased Assertion Messages:** Modified all `assert` function messages in `tests/proof_mode_tests.ts` to explicitly state the *expected successful condition* of each assertion, making them clearer and more intuitive. For example, messages now read `Expected exactly one initial hole...` instead of `Initial state report is incorrect.`.
- **Test Verification:** Reran the test suite `tests/proof_mode_tests.ts` and confirmed that all tests continue to pass with the rephrased messages, ensuring no regressions were introduced.

## What remains to be implemented:
- This task is complete. The assertion messages are now clear and accurate.

## Next user prompt:
- This task is complete. Please provide the next task.
