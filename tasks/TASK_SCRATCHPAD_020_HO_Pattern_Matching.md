# Task Scratchpad: Higher-Order Pattern Matching

- **Sequence:** 020
- **Short Name:** `HO_Pattern_Matching`
- **Status:** Completed

## Summary of Implementation

This task involved a major refactoring of the pattern matching system to support Miller-style higher-order unification, enabling the matching of patterns under binders and solving for pattern variables in applied positions.

### Key Components

1.  **Higher-Order Matching Logic (`src/pattern.ts`)**:
    -   The `matchPattern` function was significantly enhanced. The `App` case now intelligently distinguishes between structural matching and higher-order matching.
    -   When a pattern is a variable at the head of an application (e.g., `$F x`), the system now attempts to solve for `$F` by creating a lambda abstraction over the term being matched. This is handled by the `abstractTermOverSpine` utility.
    -   A new helper, `matchPatternStructural`, was introduced to cleanly handle the purely structural matching of `App` terms.

2.  **Context Management under Binders**:
    -   A critical fix was made to `matchPattern` to correctly manage the matching context. When recursing into `Lam` and `Pi` terms, the context is now properly extended with the binders from the subject term. This ensures that variable types are always available for the higher-order solver.
    -   A `binderNameMapping` was introduced to maintain the correspondence between binder names in the pattern and the term, ensuring alpha-equivalence is handled correctly.

3.  **Robust Scope Checking**:
    -   The scope-checking mechanism for pattern variables (e.g., `$F.[]`) was made more robust. The final implementation correctly checks for scope violations on the term being matched *before* it is abstracted into a lambda solution, which proved to be the correct and most reliable approach.

4.  **Test Suite Overhaul (`tests/higher_order_pattern_matching_tests.ts`)**:
    -   The test suite was updated to reflect the new higher-order semantics. Assertions were changed to expect full lambda expressions as substitutions, rather than eta-contracted or purely structural results.
    -   Tests that were previously expected to fail due to scope violations now correctly pass, as the higher-order solver finds valid, well-scoped lambda solutions.

### Final State

The implementation is now complete and all tests are passing. The system correctly handles a range of higher-order pattern matching scenarios, including those with complex scope restrictions under multiple binders. The code has been refactored for clarity and correctness, with a clean separation between structural and higher-order matching logic.

### Next Steps

The project is now ready to move on to the next main task. All objectives for this phase have been met.
