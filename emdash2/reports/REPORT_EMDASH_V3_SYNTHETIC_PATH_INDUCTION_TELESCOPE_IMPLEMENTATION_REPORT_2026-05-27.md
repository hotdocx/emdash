# emdash v3.2 Synthetic Path Induction Telescope Implementation Report

Date: 2026-05-27.

This report records the implementation pass for
`reports/REPORT_EMDASH_V3_SYNTHETIC_PATH_INDUCTION_TELESCOPE_PLAN_2026-05-27.md`.

## Implemented

- Added the primary telescope theorem:

```text
PathInd_transfd(Z)
  : Transfd(PathOutReflEval_funcd(Z), PathOutPi_funcd(Z)).
```

- Added the component projection:

```text
PathInd_transfd(Z)[x] = PathInd_func(Z,x).
```

- Added focused computation checks:

```text
PathInd_transfd(Z)[x][E]    = path_ind_func_fapp0(Z,x,E)
PathInd_transfd(Z)[x][E](u) = path_ind_sec(Z,x,E,u)
```

- Rerouted the first fixed-`x` transitivity benchmark through
  `PathInd_transfd`.

- Added generic Sigma-total uncurrying:

```text
Sigma_transfd_funcd(eta)[(k,r)] = eta[k][r].
```

- Replaced `PathInd_funcd` as a primitive source of truth. It is now defined by:

```text
PathInd_funcd(Z) = Sigma_transfd_funcd(PathInd_transfd(Z)).
```

- Constructed:

```text
pathout_refl_arrow(Z,x,y,p)
```

from the generic Sigma transport arrow:

```text
sigma_transport_arrow(Rep_Z(x), p, id_x).
```

- Added the generic capped identity functor action rule:

```text
id_func[p] = p.
```

This was needed for the endpoint computation:

```text
Rep_Z(x)[p](id_x) = p.
```

- Replaced the primitive rho-section by its path-induction-derived
  presentation:

```text
pathout_refl_arrow_sec(x)
  = path_ind_sec(Rep_{PathOut_Z(x)}((x,id_x)), id_{(x,id_x)}).
```

Its component computes to the same `pathout_refl_arrow(Z,x,y,p)`.

## Design Notes

The old Sigma-total presentation is now derived from the telescope theorem. Its
component checks live after the generic `tdapp0_fapp0`/`Sigma_transfd_funcd`
projection layer, because a transparent derived `PathInd_funcd` unfolds before
the generic projection rule is available.

The `rho` construction is no longer an axiom. Full `rho` coherence, such as
compatibility with composition in `PathOut_transport`, remains deferred.

`pathout_refl_arrow_sec` is now transparent. A focused probe showed that the
path-induction-derived definition checks once the old explicit
`tapp0_fapp0(pathout_refl_arrow_sec, Struct_sigma ...)` component rewrite rule
is removed. The earlier timeout came from that overlapping reduction path, not
from the component assertion itself.

Do not define `pathout_refl_arrow` itself as the component of
`pathout_refl_arrow_sec` in the current architecture. That section is defined
through `path_ind_sec`, and the component rule for `path_ind_sec` uses
`pathout_refl_arrow`; making `pathout_refl_arrow` unfold back to that component
would create a recursive computation path. The component equality is therefore
kept as an assertion rather than as the defining equation.

## Validation

The implementation was probed in temporary copies before being applied to
`emdash3_2.lp`. Temporary files were removed.

Commands run successfully:

```bash
timeout 60s lambdapi check -w emdash3_2.lp
EMDASH_TYPECHECK_TIMEOUT=60s make check
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
```

## Remaining Work

- Expose more of the generic `Sigma_transfd_funcd` action/naturality only when
  a concrete downstream theorem needs it.
- Develop the full `rho` coherence laws.
- Keep global coherent motive families deferred; they are not the core
  path-induction constructor.
