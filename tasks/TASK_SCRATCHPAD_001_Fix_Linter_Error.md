# TASK_SCRATCHPAD_001_Fix_Linter_Error.md

## What has already been implemented:
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified that the TypeScript linter error `Type '...' is not assignable to type 'never'` in `src/proof.ts` was caused by `Hole` and `Var` terms falling through to the `default` case of the `switch` statement in `getHoleGoal` when they were not the target hole or did not contain it.
- **Fix Implemented:** Modified `getHoleGoal` in `src/proof.ts` to explicitly return `null` for `Hole` and `Var` terms if they are not the target hole or do not contain it, preventing them from reaching the `default` case and resolving the type error.
- **Linter Verification:** Ran `npx eslint src/**/*.ts` to confirm that the fix successfully resolved the linter error and did not introduce new ones.

## What remains to be implemented:
- This task is complete. The linter error has been resolved and verified.
