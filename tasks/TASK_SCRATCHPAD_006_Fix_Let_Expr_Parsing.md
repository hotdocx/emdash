# Task Scratchpad: Fix `let` Expression Parsing

- **Task Name:** `Fix_Let_Expr_Parsing`
- **Sequence Number:** `006`
- **Status:** COMPLETED

---

## Summary of Work

The primary goal of this task was to correctly implement parsing for `let` expressions in `src/parser.ts`. The initial implementation caused test failures due to incorrect handling of lexical scope.

### Implemented Solution

The final, successful solution involved a multi-step refactoring and bug-fixing process:

1.  **Corrected Variable Substitution:** The `replaceFreeVar` function in `src/pattern.ts` was made less strict to handle variable substitution correctly within nested scopes.

2.  **Scope-Aware Parser Architecture:** The core of the solution was re-architecting `src/parser.ts`. A `buildParser(boundVars: string[])` function was introduced. This factory function creates a new set of parser rules that are aware of the variables currently in scope.

3.  **Dynamic Scoping with `parsimmon.chain()`:** For parsing `let`, `λ`, and `Π` expressions, the parser now uses `parsimmon.chain()`. This powerful construct allows the parser to be dynamic. It first parses the binder variable (e.g., `let x = ...`), adds `x` to the list of `boundVars`, and then creates a *new* parser with this updated scope to parse the expression body (the part after `in`). This correctly enforces lexical scoping.

4.  **Keyword Management:** A common parsing pitfall was resolved by explicitly defining a list of `keywords` (`let`, `in`, `Type`). The `Identifier` parser was modified to explicitly fail if it attempts to parse a keyword. This prevents the parser from greedily consuming keywords as parts of other expressions (e.g., parsing the `in` as part of the definition of a `let` expression).

5.  **Final Bug Fix:** A `ReferenceError` was traced to an incorrect use of a template string in a `parsimmon.assert()` error message. This was fixed by passing a function to generate the error message, which resolved the crash that was causing all tests to fail.

### Outcome

All 21 parser tests located in `tests/parser_tests.ts` are now passing. The parser is robust, handles scoping correctly, and properly distinguishes between identifiers and reserved keywords. The original task is now complete.
